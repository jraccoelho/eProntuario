#eProntuario
This is the project to build a "Brazilian 'Prontuario'" solution for health professionals
to be able to manage their medical appointments with their pacients.
The idea is to provide them with a suite that permits their records to be generated/updated
for each pacient and them coordinating the treatment.

##Architecture
The solution will be bulit using:
	- Angular for the front-end
	- Java for the back-end
	- MySQL for the database (no scripts were provided in the project, as the configuration
	  for the application is to create the DDL commands with JAVA, not the database.

##More to come.
